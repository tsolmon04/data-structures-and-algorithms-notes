An array is a type of data structure that consists of an ordered and contiguous group of elements. Since computers only understand data in the form of 0's and 1's, each element in the array is converted to bytes, which are then translated into bits. Typically, integers require 4 bytes (32 bits) in memory, hence the addresses are 4 bytes apart. Characters require 1 byte (8 bits) and their addresses are 1 byte apart. Additionally, an address and a value are associated with each integer upon being stored in the RAM. An address is a unique location where each value is stored, and each value is stored contiguously, similar to how an array works.",
